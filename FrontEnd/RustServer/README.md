# RUST
- In this folder there is:
	- a simple server written in [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
	- it uses the [Rocket API](https://rocket.rs/) 
- To set up the system for rust you will need to run the rust bash script found in the root folder

	bash initSetupRust.sh

- Once Rust has been set up you can navigate to 

	Cloud/FrontEnd/RustServer/simpleServer

	- and run:
	
	cargo run
